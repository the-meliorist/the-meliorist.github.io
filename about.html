    <h1>♡ about me . . . ♡ </h1>

    <p> i'm kai, but i also go by james on some parts of the web . . . <br>
    i live in the united states, in the midwest. my interests include history, politics, and other things, though history and politics are my largest interests. <br>
    <p>
    the title of this site, 'the meliorist', is inspired by many things. first off, the style of it is inspired by the federalist (papers). second, the word <em> meliorist </em> comes from meliorism, which is the belief that the world tends to improve and that humanity can aid to its betterment. so, a meliorist is someone who is a believer in that school of thought, in this case. i'm a very firm meliorist ♡ <br>
    <p>
    i love history very much, and am inspired by figures from history. my "specialization" of history is the american revolution, or rather, the founding fathers. my favorite founding father is benjamin franklin, or john jay, in case that was important :3 i enjoy talking about history, so i'll likely ramble lots about it on here. i hope i can share my affections for history with you, or even convince you to enjoy history as well.<br>
    <p>
    i'm pretty ambitious ... i'm hoping to head to harvard and graduate with a concentration/major in political science/government and a minor (sub-concentration?) in philosophy or something... then harvard law! of course, if i can't head to harvard, perhaps stanford or yale is another choice for me... either way, i hope to get lots of knowledge and have some form of higher education. knowledge is something i value a whole lot :3c
    <p>
    i hope to change the world one day, it's one of my biggest dreams and goals in life. i want to better humanity, i want to help bring humanity together and improve our world and lives... of course, i can't really do that right now, at least at such a large scale. so, i'll start small, helping others with their qualms, big or small. helping others is good, no matter the size; what truly matters is that you <em> helped. </em> i started rambling, but i'll be sure to talk more about this later on.
    <p>
    and i think that's pretty much it, for now. now you know the basics about me; welcome to the inner-depths of my mind.
