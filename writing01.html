and yet i wonder if it is ever worth living. i wonder if life was ever worth living for in the first place. in the grand scheme of things and the inner workings of the vast universe, there was never a true objective for humanity and all else to accomplish. i guess, to individuals, there is one. but i guess i’m beyond individuality and groups at this point. books and papers are just jumbled together like alphabet soup, i sleep, wake up, eat, mindlessly do something, eat, continue, then sleep. with so much repetitive activity and less things to engage myself in each day, i began to crudely wonder. wondering is something that i’ve always refrained from, as it always ends up making me feel upset one way or another. however, as i do nothing but lay face up, staring at the blank ceiling, wondering is the only thing i can do. strangely enough, with enough time alone, your thoughts only grow into something more macabre, perhaps even of lovecraftian nature. i avoid thinking about it, but my thoughts cannot be stopped; human mind and thought is a powerful force. the reality of existence sinks in as i realize that maybe it IS all meaningless. maybe, what i believe is justice and what i strive to fight for, never was, and never will be worth or mean anything at all. perhaps, there is no cosmic motive for any of us, nor for humanity as a whole.<br>
<i> note: pardon any grammatical or otherwise confusing wording... i was not necessary focusing on writing this :,] like stated, this is nothing but a meaningless, clueless ramble.
